            "Overview": "Level 20 (Neighborhood) is the fourth level in Chapter 2 and the 21st level in Apeirophobia. It takes place in a suburban neighborhood with a dark atmosphere.",
            "Description": "Level 20 takes the appearance of a big neighborhood with multiple houses, lamp posts, and grassy areas. The town is covered in a very dark sky, thus making the level devoid of light. At the start of the level, you can see a car accident which had occurred sometime throughout the existence of this level. The only source of light comes from the aforementioned lamp posts which provide a measly amount of light and have a tendency to turn off when you stand under them at times which can sometimes be more specific than others. There is also seemingly worn-down infrastructure alongside the dimly-lit paths you will likely walk under. Though the road shows no signs of abruptly having an immediate issue like a sinkhole, it still doesn't change that the roads are of terrible quality.",
            "Objective": "In order to escape, the player must wander around the path of the streetlights, The streetlights will direct the player by flickering on and off when they're under the streetlights if they're going the correct way. There is an unlocked house that's next to one of the last streetlights which you will find if you've went the right way. It is very easy to know if you are at the right spot as if you move under another streetlight in a direction which leads away from the correct house, it won't flicker."

            "Overview": "Level 21 (Graveyard) is the fifth level in Chapter 2 (Escape from Reality) and the 22nd level in Apeirophobia, which is a massive forest with many interconnecting roads and sidewalks all around, which are naturally connecting to one large graveyard with a Church in range, indicated by the echoing bell chimes.",
            "Description": "Level 21 is a vast forest with numerous interconnecting roads and sidewalks everywhere, all joining up to a large graveyard with a church in a relatively close vicinity from it, with the church bells chiming numerous times when you enter the level. The paths appear to be in modest condition - not brand new but have no indications of being picked away at by time or being damaged at all. The gravestones vary between their designs, some being botonee crosses, others being Celtic crosses, or some just being regular gravestones that you're likely used to, with an oval top and shoulders. The list spans on for ages. Trees loom over the pathways, being highlighted by the gleam of the moon. The Church stands tall within the graveyard, being topped with many holy crosses placed on certain points on top of the church.\nThe Church is very interesting when you enter it, with large medieval-like doors and a gloomy inside, being dimly lit up by a couple of weak torches. A chandelier hangs from the roof in the middle of the church; at the back of the church, a few towering holy crosses hang from the wall. An interesting floor pattern is displayed, with a very striking design bound to catch the attention of anyone who looks downwards.",

    "Level 22 - Party Mall": {
        "sections": {
            "Overview": "Level 22 (Party Mall) is the sixth level in Chapter 2 (Escape From Reality) and the 23rd level in Apeirophobia. It takes the appearance of a party mall with unique fluorescent-colored designs all over the map with upbeat music playing in the background as the player roams.",
            "Description": "Level 22 is described as a party mall but highly resembles a neon arcade. Although the level does not have arcade machines, it has many high tables and chairs, reception desks, power boxes, and lots of room to roam around. Although the area is spacious, the wall ornamentations and the ceiling decor top it off with many unique fluorescent-colored designs, such as waves, shapes, outlining, and many more. The place's design is far more unique, with several wall designs aside from fluorescent decor on top of the walls and ceiling. Around the mall, you can find several other things, such as mirrors, caution signs, trash bins, welcome signs, armchairs, cans/cups, and many more. It also has several floors that go under the ground but are not accessible. The only areas accessible that go underground have escalators leading down to a smaller level of tables and chairs. Behind the pretty designs, the party mall has a bunch of shelves and spare chairs/tables in the staff-only area, thus leading to a lot of cluttering and a messy room, making it hard to navigate. A lot of the doors shown inside the level are also inaccessible, such as VIP areas, backrooms/staff rooms, and many more.",
            "Objective": "To escape this level, you need to wander around both floors until you find a room with a sign written \"Staff Only\", upon finding it, turn right then take another right, then another left and you will be greeted with the exit."

            "Description": "Level 23's design is assumed to be an abandoned and rundown hospital, with most of its medical equipment left there. As you progress, the equipment is not only abandoned, but it's also in a messy manner with thrown over hospital beds, cluttered hallways with curtains, and other sorts of hospital equipment such as IV stands, wheelchairs, gurneys, shelves, and vending machines knocked over. The lighting is dimmer at different parts of the hospital. The hospital also houses the typical rooms you would take note of in a regular hospital, such as surgery rooms, patient rooms, waiting rooms, and many more.",

    "Level 24 - Train Station": {
        "sections": {
            "Overview": "Level 24 takes place in an abandoned subway station, to which you will have no time to comprehend and analyze your surroundings or the atmosphere of the level, because, as soon as you spawn in, you will have to run for ages until you find an exit. Your surroundings may change to levels you are familiar with, or ones which may unsettle you.",
            "Description": "Level 24 seems to be a rundown and abandoned subway station, the lighting is dim and not the best, barely illuminating the walls and the place itself. Decommissioned or flipped over trains stay mobile within some of the train tracks to block you from constantly sprinting down one track. Within the middle row, there is no tracks but a long concrete path with a few pillars lining the row. The walls of the level change within some areas to levels you may remember encountering, or they may change to an unsettling texture. They vary, but some of the changes include:\nA room with Level 0\u2019s run down wallpaper.\nA room with Level 1's wallpaper.\nA room mimicking Level 6's theme (red wallpaper).\nA room covered in a golden-like color, similar to Level 14's.",
            "Objective": "The objective of Level 24 is simple: run until you find the exit. Similar to Level 6, you have to run from a large behemoth while avoiding obstacles which may stand in your way, these aforementioned obstacles being things like decommissioned or flipped over trains. Weaving between pillars or climbing upon flipped trains allow for you to successfully avoid the obstacles and continue sprinting onwards without losing your momentum. Eventually, you will come across a sinkhole within the train tracks, which you must jump down in order to escape the level."
